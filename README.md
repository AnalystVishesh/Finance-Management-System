1. Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a financial portfolio management system using SQL, which
allows users to manage their investment portfolio. The system should be able to store information
about various financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and track their
performance over time. Users should be able to add, update, and delete investments, as well as
view the current value of their portfolio based on the latest market data. The system should
also support basic reporting and analysis, such as generating portfolio performance reports and
calculating returns on investment.

1.2 Project Features:
Investment Tracking: Users can add, update, and delete investments, including stocks, bonds,
and mutual funds, along with their relevant details such as ticker symbol, quantity, purchase price,
and purchase date.

Market Data Integration: The system should integrate with external financial d ata sources
(e.g., APIs) to fetch the latest market data, such as stock prices and bond yields, in order to
calculate the current value of the investments in the portfolio.

Performance Reporting: Users can generate performance reports for their portfolio, including
metrics such as total portfolio value, returns on investment (ROI), and asset allocation.

Investment Analysis: Users can analyze their portfolio by performing calculations such as calculating
the overall performance of the portfolio, comparing the performance of different investments,
and identifying top-performing investments.

User Management: The system should have a user management system that allows users to
register, login, and manage their own portfolio data securely.

1.3 Project Deliverables:
Database schema: Define the database schema including tables, columns, and relationships between
them.
SQL queries: Write SQL queries to perform various operations such as adding, updating, and deleting
investments, fetching market data, generating performance reports, and performing investment
analysis.
Data integration: Implement data integration with external financial data sources to fetch market
data.
User interface (UI): Develop a simple user interface that allows users to interact with the system
and perform operations such as adding investments, viewing portfolio performance, and generating
reports.

1.4 Conclusion
In conclusion, this project involved creating a financial portfolio management database using SQL.
The database consists of several interconnected tables, including clients, portfolios, investments,
and returns, with appropriate foreign key relationships. Dummy data was inserted into the tables
to simulate real-world scenarios.
The project included the design and implementation of the database schema, as well as the entry
of dummy data into the tables. Additionally, 5 easy, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries were
formulated and their expected output format was provided.
This project serves as a basic example of how SQL can be used to create and manage a financial
portfolio management system. It demonstrates the use of various SQL concepts, such as creating
tables, defining relationships, inserting data, and querying data from multiple tables. The queries
provided can serve as a starting point for further exploration and customization based on specific
requirements.
Overall, this project provides a foundation for understanding how SQL can be utilized for financial
portfolio management, and can be expanded upon to build a comprehensive and robust system for
managing investments and returns in a real-world financial context.

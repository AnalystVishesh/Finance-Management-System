1. Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a financial portfolio management system using SQL, which
allows users to manage their investment portfolio. The system should be able to store information
about various financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and track their
performance over time. Users should be able to add, update, and delete investments, as well as
view the current value of their portfolio based on the latest market data. The system should
also support basic reporting and analysis, such as generating portfolio performance reports and
calculating returns on investment

1.2 Project Features:
Investment Tracking: Users can add, update, and delete investments, including stocks, bonds,
and mutual funds, along with their relevant details such as ticker symbol, quantity, purchase price,
and purchase date.

Market Data Integration: The system should integrate with external financial d ata sources
(e.g., APIs) to fetch the latest market data, such as stock prices and bond yields, in order to
calculate the current value of the investments in the portfolio.

Performance Reporting: Users can generate performance reports for their portfolio, including
metrics such as total portfolio value, returns on investment (ROI), and asset allocation.

Investment Analysis: Users can analyze their portfolio by performing calculations such as calculating
the overall performance of the portfolio, comparing the performance of different investments,
and identifying top-performing investments.

User Management: The system should have a user management system that allows users to
register, login, and manage their own portfolio data securely.
